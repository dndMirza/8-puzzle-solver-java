# 8 Puzzle Solver Java
Developed a program to solve the 8-Puzzle problem by implementing and comparing Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A* search algorithms.

## Description
Implemented UCS to find the shortest path based on the number of moves (depth in the search tree).

Designed and implemented the A* search algorithm, including a custom heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan distance or misplaced tiles) to guide the search efficiently.

Generated detailed solution outputs, including path, number of moves, and node expansion counts, for performance analysis of both algorithms.

Compared the effectiveness of UCS and A* in terms of solution quality and computational resources used.
